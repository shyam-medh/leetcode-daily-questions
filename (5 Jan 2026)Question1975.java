// Maximum Matrix Sum 

/*
You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's 
elements using the operation mentioned above.
 

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.


Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]
Output: 16
Explanation: We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:
- Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.
 

Constraints:
n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
2 <= n <= 250
-105 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105

class Solution {
    public long maxMatrixSum(int[][] matrix) {
        long sum = 0;
        int neg = 0, min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for(int i=0; i<matrix.length; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<matrix.length; j++){
                int val = Math.abs(matrix[i][j]);
                if(matrix[i][j] < 0) neg++;
                if(val < min) min = val;

                sum += val;
            }
        }

        return (neg % 2 == 0) ? sum : sum - 2 * min;
    }
