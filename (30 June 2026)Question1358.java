// Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters

/*
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.
Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.
 

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 


Example 2:
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 


Example 3:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:
3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.
